# Implementor Workshop, Aug 6-7, Seattle

## Goals and notes

The goal of the workshop is to show the current progress of Trace-Context implementations as well as a joint interoperability test suite.  If you come to the workshop you should have a working implementation of Trace-Context based context propagation. The workshop is targeted towards tracing tool providers as well as middleware providers like service meshes.

If we find the time we will also reserve a slot to continue our discussion on a joint trace data format.

## Results

Thank you all participants of Implementors Workshop! We had a very productive time discussing issues and future plans for the distributed tracing context propagation. During the workshop we closed a few outstanding issues and completed two milestones: **experiment** and **migrate**.

As part of **experiment** milestones completion we had demos from Instana, Microsoft, Google, New Relic and Dynatrace which confirm usability of protocol. As well as end-to-end trace run thru components monitored by Application Insights, Dynatrace and New Relic. Milestone **migrate** was completed as we officially transferred work from W3C community group to the [working group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/).

Our plan is to close the remaining of [issues](https://github.com/w3c/distributed-tracing/milestone/4) for the **First Public Working Draft** this month. For the **Candidate Recommendation** milestone we agreed to draft how binary, AMQP and MQTT protocols might look like to confirm that proposal is universal enough.

Thank you again for productive discussions and contributions!
