# Implementor Workshop, Aug 6-7, Seattle

## Goals and notes

The goal of the workshop is to show the current progress of Trace-Context implementations as well as a joint interoperability test suite.  If you come to the workshop you should have a working implementation of Trace-Context based context propagation. The workshop is targeted towards tracing tool providers as well as middleware providers like service meshes. 

If we find the time we will also reserve a slot to continue our discussion on a joint trace data format.
