#  Trace Context HTTP Header Format Rationale

This document provides rationale for the decisions made, mapping the
`Trace-Parent` and `Trace-State` fields to HTTP headers.

## Lowercase Concatenated header names
While HTTP headers are conventionally delimited by hyphens, the trace context
header names are not. Rather, they are lowercase concatenated "traceparent" and
"tracestate" respectively. The departure from convention is due to practical
concerns of propagation. Trace context is unlike typical http headers, which
are point-to-point and do not propagate through other systems like messaging.
Different systems have different constraints. For example, some cannot read
case insensitively, and others forbid the hyphen character. Even if we could
suggest not using the same format for such systems, we know many systems transparently
copy http headers into fields. This class of concerns only exist when we choose
to support mixed case with hyphens. By choosing not to, we open trace context
integration beyond http at the cost of a conventional distraction.

## `tracestate`

- The names should be human readable, but values opaque. Cryptic name can
interfere with identification of the tracing system responsible for an entry.
- Multiple entries permitted, but not across multiple headers. Order identifies which entry is associated with the `traceparent`. Arbitrary non-tracing system entries is a non use case.
- The typical name will be a single word in latin and the value will be a
copy of the `traceparent` format or an opaque string.

### Size limits

Header should be small so providers can satisfy the requirement to pass the value all the time.

512 bytes looks like a reasonable compromise.

TODO: put more thoughts into it

### Not trimming spaces

The `tracestate` header is not meant to be edited by hand, and the values
are opaque. Thus, optimizations such as trimming spaces before and
after the comma, equal sign, etc are not handled by this specification.

### Case sensitivity of names

There are few considerations why the names should be case sensitive:
- some keys may be a url query string parameters which are case sensitive
- forcing lower case will decrease readability of the names written in camel case

### String encoding of names

Url encoding is low-overhead way to encode unicode characters for non-latin characters in the 
values. Url encoding keeps a single words in latin unchanged and easy readable.
