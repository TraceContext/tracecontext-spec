## Problem Statement

Distributed tracing is a methodology implemented by tracing tools to follow, analyze
and debug a transaction across multiple software components. Typically, a
<a>distributed trace</a> traverses more than one component which requires it to
be uniquely identifiable across all participating systems.
Trace context propagation passes along this unique identification.

Today, trace context propagation is implemented individually by each tracing vendor.
In multi-vendor environments, this causes interoperability problems, like:

- Traces that are collected by different tracing vendors cannot be correlated
  as there is no shared unique identifier.
- Traces that cross boundaries between different tracing vendors can not be
  propagated as there is no uniformly agreed set of identification that is forwarded.
- Vendor specific metadata might be dropped by intermediaries.
- Cloud platform vendors, intermediaries and service providers, cannot guarantee
  to support trace context propagation as there is no standard to follow.

In the past, these problems did not have a significant impact as most applications
were monitored by a single tracing vendor and stayed within the boundaries of a single
platform provider. Today, an increasing number of applications are highly
distributed and leverage multiple middleware services and cloud platforms.

This transformation of modern applications calls for a distributed tracing
context propagation standard.

## Solution

The trace context specification defines a universally agreed-upon format for the
exchange of trace context propagation data - referred to as *trace context*. Trace
context solves the problems described above by

- providing an unique identifier for individual traces and requests, allowing
  trace data of multiple providers to be linked together.
- providing an agreed-upon mechanism to forward vendor-specific trace data and
  avoid broken traces when multiple trace tools participate in a single transaction.
- providing an industry standard that intermiediaries, platforms, and hardware
  providers can support.

A unified approach for propagating trace data improves visibility into the behavior
of distributed applications, facilitating problem and performance analysis.
The interoperability provided by trace-context is a prerequisite to manage modern
micro-service based applications.
