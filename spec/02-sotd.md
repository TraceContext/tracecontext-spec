There are a few implementations of this protocol available. Experimental interoperability
scenarios were run and have demonstrated promising results. The specification will be
progressed into Candidate Recommendation stage after that, drafts for <a href='https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-binary/'>binary</a>, <a href='https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-amqp/'>AMQP</a> and
<a href='https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-mqtt/'>MQTT</a> protocols will be written to make sure the concepts and structure defined
in this specification can be ported to other protocols.
