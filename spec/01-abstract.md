# Problem Statement

Distributed tracing is a methodology implemented by tracing tools to follow, analyze
and debug a transaction across multiple software components. Typically, a trace
traverses more than one component which requires it to be uniquely identifiable
across all participating systems. Passing along this unique identification is
provided by *trace context propagation*.

Today, trace context propagation is implemented individually by each vendor.
In multi-vendor environments, this causes interoperability problems, like:

- Traces that are collected by different tracing vendors cannot be linked together
  as there is no shared unique identifier.
- Traces that cross boundaries between different tracing vendors break as there
  is no uniformly agreed set of identification that is forwarded.
- Cloud platform vendors, as well as hardware vendors, cannot guarantee to support
  trace context propagation as there is no standard to follow.

In the past, these problems did not have a significant impact as most applications
were monitored by a single tracing tool and stayed within the boundaries of a single
platform provider. Today, an increasing number of applications are highly
distributed and leverage multiple middleware services and cloud platforms.

## Solution

The trace context specification defines a universally agreed-upon format for the
exchange of trace context propagation data - referred to as *trace context*. Trace
context solves the problems described above by

- providing a unique identifier for individual traces, allowing traces of multiple
  providers to be linked together.
- providing an agreed-upon mechanism to forward vendor-specific trace data and
  avoid broken traces when multiple trace tools participate in a single transaction.
- providing an industry standard that platform- and hardware-providers can support.

A unified approach for propagating trace data improves visibility into the behavior
of distributed applications, facilitating problem and performance analysis.
The interoperability provided by trace-context is a prerequisite to manage modern
micro-service based applications.
