# Other protocols

While trace context is defined for HTTP the authors acknowledge it is also relevant
for other protocols. Extensions of this specification define the format of trace
context serialization anddeserialization for other protocols.
Note, that these extensions may be at a different maturity level than this specification.

Please refer to the [protocols
registry](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-protocols-registry/) for the
details of trace context implementation for other protocols.
